# Set the `cxx26` modifier for all targets in this directory. This lets us
# build the targets in this project without having to pass `--modifier`/`-m`
# via the command line.
# Note that we can also add the `modifier` attribute to individual target
# definitions instead, which has higher priority, but setting it at the
# `PACKAGE` level is more convenient/less error-prone if all targets in the
# project should be affected.
